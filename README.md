# Brain-Tumor-Prediction-using-Xception
In this model i have used Transfer Learning technique to classify diffrent kind of brain tumors
such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary and non tumor . I used a famous pretrained model Xception
for feature extraction and then added few more fully connected layers to fine tune.
