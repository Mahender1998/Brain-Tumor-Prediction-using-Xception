# Brain-Tumor-Prediction-using-Xception
In this model i have used Transfer Learning technique to classify diffrent kind of brain tumors
such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary and non-tumor . I used a famous pre-trained model Xception
for feature extraction and then added a few more fully connected layers to fine-tune.
